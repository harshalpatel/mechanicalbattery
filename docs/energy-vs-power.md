Energy is the capacity to do work; it measures the total amount of work done.

Power is the rate of producing or consuming energy.

A solar system for a house is rated as 9kw (kilowatts); it can produce electricty at that rate (power). If the solar system produces 9kw for 1 hour, it produces 9kWh (kilowatt hours) of electricity. Simply put, energy is power integrated over time.

<br >
A light bulb that is 10 watts (power) will likely emit less light than an equivalent type that is 20 watts (power). Over the course of one hour, the 10 watt light bulb will use 10 watt hours of energy

Power is often measured in watts and energy in watt hours. 

For energy storage, a battery is rated at a certain power and capacity (energy usually in kWh)
