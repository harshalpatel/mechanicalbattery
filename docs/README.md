# The Mechanical Battery

The Mechanical Battery is an energy storage solution that can cost effectively store excess renewwable energy.

The pages on this site document the research, development and hopefully deployment of this battery.

## Battery Characteristics
---

The following is a list of various battery characteristics

1. Energy Density (volumetrics and gravimetric)<br >
The amount of energy that can be stored in an amount of space and per unit of weight. 

2. Cost (energy and power)<br >
The cost per unit of energy (kwH) and power (kW)
Batteries can be energy or power limited. 

3. Power output<br >
How fast a battery can be charged or discharged. 

4. Cycle Life<br >
Numer of times a batter can discharge or recharge before it degrades to no longer be useful.

5. Round Trip Efficiency<br >
Losses during charging and discharging. 

6. Environmental: Safety, Temperation and Noise<br >
Some batteries are temperature sensitive, some emit a lot of noise and some can easily catch fire.
