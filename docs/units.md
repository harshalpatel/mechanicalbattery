## Systems
Two systems of unit memasurements exist: International System of Units (SI / modern metric) and Imperial / US Customary measurement system.

Differences exist in the commonly used measurements but for energy and power, they are the same. For this project we'll will quote everything in both US Imperial and Standard International.

| Volume | milliliters, liters, etc           | cubic feet, gallons, ounces   |
| Power  | watts, kilowatts, megawatts,       | No difference                 |
| Energy | watt-hours, joule                  | No difference                 |
